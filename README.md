***Ecommerce Purchases Data Analysis***
Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis of an ecommerce purchases dataset using Python's Pandas library. The analysis involves various operations like data filtering, aggregation, and pattern identification based on purchase data.

Files
main.py: This is the main script that contains the code to perform the data analysis. The script includes various operations such as displaying top and bottom rows, checking datatypes and null values, analyzing purchase prices, filtering based on job titles, and identifying patterns like email providers and credit card details.

Ecommerce Purchases.csv: This is the dataset used in the analysis. It contains information about purchases made by customers on an ecommerce platform, including details like purchase prices, email addresses, job titles, and credit card information.
